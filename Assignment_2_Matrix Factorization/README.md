Use the instructor's notebook on matrix factorisation, and solve the following questions.

Use the above image from Q4 and complete the rectangular missing patch for three cases, i.e. a rectangular block of 30X30 is assumed missing from the image. Choose rank r yourself. Vary the patch location as follows. [2 Marks]

an area with mainly a single color.
an area with 2-3 different colors.
an area with at least 5 different colors.
Perform Gradient Descent till convergence, plot the selected patches, original and reconstructed images, compute the metrics mentioned in Q4 and write your observations. Obtain the reconstruction using RFF + Linear regression and compare the two.

Vary patch size (NxN) for N = [20, 40, 60, 80, 100] and peform Gradient Descent till convergence. Demonstrate the variation in reconstruction quality by making appropriate plots and metrics. [2 Marks]

Reconstruct the same patches using RFF. Compare the results and write your observations.

Write a function using this reference and use alternating least squares instead of gradient descent to repeat Part 1, 2 of Q5, using your written function. [2 Marks]

Consider a patch of size (100x100) with at least 5 colors. Vary the low-rank value as r = [5, 10, 50, 100] . Use Gradient Descent and plot the reconstructed images to demonstrate difference in reconstruction quality. Write your observations. [1 Mark]
